# Work-Day-Scheduler

## About the Project

This work day scheduler was created to allow for a place for employees and students with busy schedules to plan their days and manage their time effectively. The scheduler displays a light purple color for any part of the day that have already passed, a red color for the hour that we are currently in, and a green color for future hours. Each hour allows you to enter specific tasks or reminders, when you click the save button for each timeblock your information will be saved to local storage. Upon refreshing the page, your saved data will still be visible.
